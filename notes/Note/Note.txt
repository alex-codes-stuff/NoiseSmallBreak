collaboration would be neat.
join the cheesed up discord (discord.gg/peppino)
and help with sprite recreations.

Bad recreations (need remaking):
- jump
- fall
- dive
- turn
- mach2jump
- mach2fall

Sprites todo:
- backflip start
- backflip fall
- wall slide going up
- wall slide going down
- wall slide jump (shown in the video with the decorated level)
- fork slide
- jump after slide start
- jump after slide fall
- noisette idle

Sprites not priority:
- HUD
- Tileset
- Background
- Collectibles
- Enemies
- Particles
